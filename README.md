This is a proof of concept. docker-compose up to get started.

It proofs a user can upload 
a pdf file which is parsed and then converted to an audiopaper in mp3 format. 

This could be useful to anyone who wants to keep up to date on professional, or academic papers in her field of interest. 

This field is severy lacking a way to _listen_ to papers. Audiopapers wants to fix that.

It works, that is all I can say about it for now :-)

There are a ton of ideas ofcourse. For instance:

- When parsing the pdf, each paragraph should have a marker in the final audio paper for easy navigation around in the paper.
- This really needs a nice native mobile app (iOS, Android).
- You should be able to convert reference into a format that makes sense to listen. Just reading a reference or citation adds little value, at least the UI should show the ref but surely we can come up with something better.
- The user should be able to add her own audio notes to the paper.
